# 🛣️ Assignment 3: Optimization of a City Transportation Network(Minimum Spanning Tree) 




# Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to apply Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms to
optimize a city’s transportation network by determining the minimum set of roads that
connect all city districts with the lowest possible total construction cost. Students will
also analyze the efficiency of both algorithms and compare their performance.
